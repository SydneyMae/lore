# Dr. Sydney Morrison

Personnel ID: FMS-003349-H
Clearance Level: Level 3
Position: 4th Year Resident / Hematologist
Department: Foundation Medical Service

### Early Life
Dr. Morrison was born and raised in a small suburban town in Minnesota, in a middle-class Catholic family. Her father was a Navy Intelligence Officer, and her mother was a pediatric nurse. From a young age, Dr. Morrison had always been interested in science and medicine, but the death of her brother influenced her carreer path. She graduated early from the University of Minnesota with a degree in biochemistry and enrolled in medical school in 2022 at the age of 20.

### Foundation Recruitment
In 2023, Dr. Morrison treated a patient with a strange, almost... anomalous blood-borne pathogen. As it would turn out, this was a test planted by the Foundation to test her skills.  She was officially recruited by the Foundation after she unknowingly saved the life of Dr. Maria Jones, who had presented to the Abbott Northwestern Hospital ER with critical symptoms. She joined the Foundation Medical Service as a 2nd Year resident, specializing in hematology and blood-related anomalies. 

### Strange Traits
Some Foundation staff members have reported that Dr. Morrison has a strangely commanding presence, nicknamed "The look from Hell". This look is an intense stare that somehow compels people to comply with her wishes. It is unknown at this time if this trait is memetic in nature, but it has been noted in many reports. 

### Strange Behavior
FMS personnel have reported strange actions and behaviors that lead people to assume Dr. Morrison has an affiliation with some sort of covert religious organization. Certain FMS personnel, like Dr. Epione, have described her to be "Nun-like" at times... whatever that means. There are no records of Dr. Morrison being a part of any organization other than the Foundation and "SCP-999's Fan Club". It has been reported that she has at times muttered Latin phrases during high-stress situations, and that she always keeps a small, old pocket Bible on her person. 

### That Damn Medkit...
No one knows how Dr. Morrison got her hands on it, but she owns a standard-issue Foundation Medical Services medkit with strange anomalous features. It contains a pocket dimension full of medical supplies, snacks, cooled drinks, and books. This dimension can only be accessed if the medkit is handled by specific FMS staff members. Members who can access the medkit's pocket dimension are as follows: Dr. Sydney Morrison, Dr. Epione, Dr. Vale, FMS Director Dr. Eurus, Dr. June, and... Janice? How the hell can a frog access the pocket dimension?

Attempts from others to try to gain access to the dimension has led to failure. With one exception... See report OScD-00284-BE. It is unknown how the medkit is able to differentiate between staff members. OScD believes that it may be some sort of Thuamic signature.

Object Class: Thaumic Medkit (TMK-001)
Special Containment Procedures: TMK-001 is to remain in the personal possession of Dr. Sydney Morrison (FMS-003349-H) at all times during her duty shifts. Under no circumstances (*NO CIRCUMSTANCES*) is any O5 personnel to attempt access without prior approval from at least three other O5 members and FMS Director Dr. Eurus. Previous attempts have resulted in... well, see below. TMK-001 is not to be referred to as "That Damn Medkit" or "The Lunchbox from Hell" in official correspondence. (Note: I'm looking at you, O5-7.)

Post-incident, TMK-001 has been fitted with a GPS tracker disguised as a Foundation-issued lanyard clip. Dr. Morrison was... less than thrilled about this. Her exact words: "Touch my kit again and I'll pray for your soul while I watch you bleed out." Charming.

Description: TMK-001 is a standard-issue FMS medkit (Model MK-17B) with confirmed anomalous properties. Contains extradimensional storage space (est. volume: 500m³) stocked with medical supplies, MREs, chilled energy drinks, assorted fiction paperbacks (mostly Grisham and King), and one (1) perpetually fresh pack of Twizzlers. Access restricted to verified personnel via unknown thaumic/blood signature (research ongoing, OSCD team swears it's "soul-based" or some shit).

Authorized users: Dr. Morrison, Dr. Epione, Dr. Vale, Dr. Eurus, Dr. June, and Janice (the frog. Don't ask. I did once. I regret it...)

Unauthorized access attempts result in denial of entry, minor reality-bending fuckery, or (rarely) expulsion of irrelevant items. See Incident Log.


Incident OScD-00284-BE: "O5 vs. The Lunchbox From Hell"
Date: 10/14/2025, 0234 hours
Location: Site-45, Medical Locker Room
Summary: O5-█ (redacted per protocol, but we all know who) decided, in a moment of what I can only describe as O5 hubris, that he "needed a goddamn Red Bull" after a 14-hour containment breach clusterfuck with SCP-████. Instead of ringing for an intern like a normal overpaid demigod, he "borrowed" TMK-001 from Dr. Morrison's on-call locker. (How? Don't know. Probably that O5 voodoo.)

Log Excerpt (CCTV + Audio):
> [BEGIN LOG]
> O5-█ enters med bay locker room. Grabs TMK-001 off shelf. Mutters: "Fucking FMS and their magic Mary Poppins bags. Let's see what you've got."
> Opens latch. No anomalous reaction initially. Reaches in.
> Sudden gust of wind. Papers fly everywhere. O5-█'s tie levitates briefly.
> O5-█: "What the f-"
> TMK-001 vibrates. A single roll of gauze shoots out like a goddamn cannonball, smacking O5-█ square in the forehead. He staggers back, cursing in ████████.
> Gauze unravels mid-air, wrapping around his left hand like a shitty mummy costume. Pocket dimension slams shut with audible WHUMP. TMK-001 locks itself, latch glowing faintly red (Was it angry?).
> O5-█ yanks at latch repeatedly. Nothing. Starts kicking it. The locker room security alarm gets triggered.
> Dr. Morrison bursts in 2 minutes later, still in scrubs, Bible tucked in pocket. Gives O5-█ The Look From Hell™. Room temperature drops 5°F.
> Dr. Morrison: "Sir. With all due respect... what the fuck are you doing with my kit?"
> O5-█ (unraveling gauze, red-faced): "I- uh- needed-"
> Dr. Morrison snatches TMK-001. Latch pops open instantly. Pulls out chilled Red Bull, hands it over.
> Dr. Morrison: "Next time, ask. Or I'll let Janice handle you." Motions to frog in her pocket. Janice croaks menacingly.
> [END LOG]

Aftermath:
- O5-█ suffered a minor forehead contusion. 
- TMK-001 returned to Dr. Morrison. Dimension restocked itself overnight, now includes extra gauze (ironic).
- Dr. Morrison filed informal complaint: "If the Overwatch wants snacks, they can have their damn interns bring them"


Addendum 00284-BE-1: O5 Directive
All O5 personnel are hereby forbidden from interacting with TMK-001. Violators will be demoted to D-Class lunch duty.

Addendum 00284-BE-2: Personal Note from Logging Officer (Dr. R. Caldwell, OSCD)
Look, I've seen some weird shit in 12 years with the Foundation. Keter breaches, reality anchors failing, that one time SCP-999 unionized the other Safe class SCPs... But an O5 getting punked by a medkit? And a frog having higher clearance?

We're doomed. Praise be to whatever saint Dr. Morrison prays to.

OScD-00284-CF

Object Class: Memetic Glare Hazard (MGH-001) - "The Look From Hell"
Special Containment Procedures: Ethics Committee personnel (Clearance 4/5) may observe OR procedures at Site-45 only from the gallery, behind one-way glass, with audio muted. No entry to the sterile field without written approval from FMS Director Dr. Eurus and the lead surgeon. Violators will be escorted out by MTF Epsilon-6 and banned from Site-45 medical wings for 90 days. Repeat offenders get reassigned to SCP-████ ethics reviews... permanently.

MGH-001 remains non-lethal, non-replicating, and tied exclusively to Dr. Sydney Morrison (FMS-003349-H). It is recommended that you do not test this anomaly by provoking Dr. Morrison. In fact, I wouldn't advise breathing wrong in her vicinity.

Description: MGH-001 is a spontaneous memetic effect triggered by Dr. Morrison under duress. No incantation, no focus object, just eye contact. Common symptoms in target include, but are not limited to: immediate compliance, loss of motor control, spontaneous confession of minor sins (e.g., “I stole a pen in 2018”). OSCD classifies it as E-class thaumic compulsion. Dr. Morrison classifies it as "a normal Tuesday".

Incident OScD-00284-CF: “Ethics Gets Schooled in OR-1”
Location: Site-45, MD OR-1 (Its the only OR, why does it need a special designation?)
Summary: Emergency hemic resection on D-8821 (SCP-████ exposure, blood crystallizing into rosary-like structures). Surgical team involved: Dr. Hope (Lead), Dr. Morrison (anesthesia), Dr. Epione (anesthesia), Dr. June (circulator). Mid-procedure, Ethics Committee Senior Liaison Dr. Evelyn Carter (Clearance 5, Site-45 Ethics Chair) barged in to “halt unauthorized anomalous transfusion.” She would soon realize that she had just made a big mistake.

Log Excerpt (OR feed, audio redacted for patient privacy):
> [BEGIN LOG]
> Morrison, masked, voice low: “June, pack the left lobe. Epione, push more profopol"
> The OR doors burst open, Dr. Carter storms in, with all of the entitlement Level 5 grants you, tablet glowing with EC-17-C violation flags.
> Carter: “Dr. Morrison, cease transfusion immediately! This blood is unregistered anomalous material, EC directive supersedes-”
> Morrison doesn’t flinch. Turns only her head. THE LOOK fires. OR temp drops 4°F. Overhead lights flicker like they would in a horror game.
> Epione (under breath): “Oh no.”
> June (already backing up): “Dr. C, you picked the wrong shift.”
> Carter locks eyes. Tablet slips from her fingers, clatters. Face goes sheet-white. Mouth opens, but no sound came out.
> Carter (whisper, trembling): “I… misfiled the form. It’s approved. Carry on.” She then turned and walked straight into an instrument tray, but didn't seem to notice.
> Morrison (turning back to patient): “June, door. Epione, more suction. We’re not losing this one to bureaucracy.”
> TMK-001 ejects a fresh unit of O-neg on its own. Janice ribbits once, almost as if laughing at the Ethics Committee member. The procedure was a success.
> [END LOG]

Aftermath:
- D-8821 stabilized. Crystals dissolved. Full recovery projected.
- Dr. Carter filed a self-correction to EC-17-C within 6 minutes.
- Site-45 Ethics now routes all medical overrides through Dr. Eurus first. Carter hasn’t entered an OR since.
- TMK-001 restocked with extra saline and a single Twizzler labeled “For the frog.” Janice approved.

Addendum 00284-CF-1: O5 Directive
Ethics Committee (Site-45): You have Clearance 5. Dr. Morrison has results. Respect the chain.

Addendum 00284-CF-2: Personal Note from Logging Officer (Dr. R. Caldwell, OSCD)
Carter’s a legend in Ethics—wrote half the D-Class consent forms. One look from Morrison and she folded like origami... What hell is even going on...
